I am a cell biologist with extensive scientific knowledge in microbiology, host-pathogen interaction and advanced microscopy approaches. I have over 10 years experience in scientific project design/management, undergraduate and postgraduate student supervision and writing/communication of scientific information to both expert and non-expert audiences. To attest to this I am lead author in several high profile publications with over 1300 citations (Google Scholar: dQvQ0AAAAJ), have supervised multiple Master and PhD students, and have been actively involved in several outreach initiatives (In2Science, ITQB-NOVA open day). I have served in several decision boards in Universidade Nova de Lisboa, University College London and the Francis Crick Institute where I have worked with academic, industrial and political partners to define scientific and institutional vision and impact strategies. Experience that has provided me with a comprehensive view about the scientific landscape. From a research point of view I have made significant contributions in the fields of S. aureus microbiology (e.g. discovering a link between peptidoglycan and wall teichoic acids biosynthesis), host-pathogen interaction (e.g. importance of autolysins for immune evasion, or the role of septins in the recognition of intracellular pathogens) and hardware and software technological innovations for microscopy (e.g. NanoJ-Fluidics and NanoJ-SRRF).
