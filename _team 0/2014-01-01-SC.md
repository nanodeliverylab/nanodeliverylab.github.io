My research centres on developing novel analytical approaches for fluorescence microscopy. I helped develop the Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations (SRRF) algorithm, which extracts super-resolution information from conventional fluorescence microscopy time-series, and allows for live-cell super-resolution imaging in physiological conditions without specialised fluorophores. I also developed the Super-Resolution Quantitative Image Rating and Reporting of Error Locations (SQUIRREL) algorithm, which is a method for assessing the quality of super-resolution microscopy images. I also develop analytical methods for microbiology, including the creation of image analysis pipelines for characterising nuclear envelope architecture during mitosis in S. pombe (in collaboration with Gautam Dey, LMCB) and characterising cell division in thermophilic Archaea (in collaboration with Uwe Schmidt, MPI-CBG).
