<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
As soon as nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles (NPs), are injected into a physiological environment a rich coating of biomolecules known as the “protein corona” rapidly covers them. This protein dress is the main factor, which affects the interaction of NPs with living systems. While the relationship between NP features and the biomolecule corona has been extensively investigated, whether and how changes in the physiological environment affect the NP–protein corona remains under-investigated. This is one of the most important steps in translating results in animal models to the clinic. Here we investigated thoroughly the biological identity of lipid NPs (size, charge, aggregation state and composition of the corona) after incubation with human plasma (HP) and mouse plasma (MP) by dynamic light scattering, micro-electrophoresis and nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/MS-MS). Specifically, we used two different liposomal formulations: the first one was made of polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-coated 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), while the second one was made of 30% of DOTAP, 50% of neutral saturated 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and 20% cholesterol. The temporal evolution and complexity of the NP–protein corona was found to be strongly dependent on the biological environment. In MP, liposomes were more negatively charged, less enriched in opsonins and appreciably more enriched in apolipoproteins than their counterparts in HP. Collectively, our results suggest that the biological identities of NPs in mice and humans can be markedly different from each other. Relevance of results to in vivo applications is discussed.
