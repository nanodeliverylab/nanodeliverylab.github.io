<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Time-lapse optical microscopy datasets from living cells can potentially afford an enormous amount of quantitative information on the relevant structural and dynamic properties of sub-cellular organelles/structures, provided that both the spatial and temporal dimensions are properly sampled during the experiment. Here we provide exemplary live-cell, time-lapse confocal imaging datasets corresponding to three sub-cellular structures of the endo-lysosomal pathway, i.e. early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes, along with detailed guidelines to produce analogous experiments. Validation of the datasets is conducted by means of established analytical tools to extract the structural and dynamic properties at the sub-cellular scale, such as Single Particle Tracking (SPT) and imaging derived Mean Square Displacement (iMSD) analyses. In our aim, the present work would help other researchers in the field to reuse the provided datasets for their own scopes, and to combine their creative approaches/analyses to similar acquisitions.
