<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
A possible turning point in drug delivery has been recently reached: the protein shell, which covers nanocarriers in vivo, can be used for targeting. Here, we show that nanoparticles can acquire a selective targeting capability with a protein corona adsorbed on the surface. We demonstrate that lipid particles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA, upon interaction with human plasma components, spontaneously become coated with vitronectin that promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin ανβ3 integrin receptor.
