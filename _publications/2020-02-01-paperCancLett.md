<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often detected too late to allow adequate treatments with the result that patients are condemned to sufferings and early death. Most efforts have been therefore aimed at identifying sensitive PDAC biomarkers. Although biomarkers have numerous advantages, sample size, intra-individual variability, existence of several biases and confounding variables and cost of investigation make their clinical application challenging. In recent years, nanotechnology is providing new options for early cancer detection. Among recent discoveries, the concept is emerging that the protein corona, i.e. the layer of plasma proteins that surrounds nanomaterials in bodily fluids, is personalized. In particular, the protein corona of cancer patients is significantly different from that of healthy individuals. Herein, we review this concept with a particular focus on clinical relevance. We also discuss the recently developed nanoparticle-enabled blood (NEB) tests that demonstrated to be promising in discriminating PDAC patients from healthy volunteers by global change of the nanoparticle-protein corona. We conclude with a critical discussion of research perspectives aimed at further improving the prediction ability of the test.
