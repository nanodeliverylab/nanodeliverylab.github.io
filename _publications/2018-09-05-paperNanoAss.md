<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Recent advances in biochemical and biophysical research have been achieved through the employment of microfluidic devices. Microfluidic mixing of therapeutic agents with biomaterials yields systems with finely tuned physical-chemical properties for applications in drug and gene delivery. Here, we investigate the role of preparation technology (microfluidic mixing vs. bulk self-assembly) on the transfection efficiency (TE) and cytotoxicity of multicomponent cationic liposome/DNA complexes (lipoplexes) in live Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. Decoupling TE and cytotoxicity allowed us to combine them in a unique coherent vision. While bulk self-assembly produces highly efficient and highly toxic MC lipoplexes, microfluidics manufacture leads to less efficient, but less cytotoxic complexes. This discrepancy is ascribed to two main factors controlling lipid-mediated cell transfection, i.e. the lipoplex concentration at the cell surface and the lipoplex arrangement at the nanoscale. Further research is required to optimize microfluidic manufacturing of lipoplexes to obtain highly efficient and not cytotoxic gene delivery systems.
