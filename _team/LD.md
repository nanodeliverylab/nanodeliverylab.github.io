Physicist by training, I approached to life and health siences just after graduating. My research activity mainly focuses on the computational aspects of the lab's studies on protein-nanomaterial interactions. I enjoy coding custom scripts for statistical data analysis, curve fitting and image processing tools. 
My main project aims to the development of nanoparticle-enabled blood tests for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. <br><br>
