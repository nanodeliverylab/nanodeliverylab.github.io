Physicist by training, I approached to life and health siences just after graduating. My research activity mainly focuses on the computational aspects of the lab's studies on protein-nanomaterial interactions. As an instance, I helped develop an image processing tool (iMSD) for the quantitative analysis of the intracellular dynamics of nanoparticles. <br>

I am currently working on the development of nanoparticle-enabled blood tests for the early detection of pancreatic cancer.  <br>
