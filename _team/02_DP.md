After humanistic education, I obtained my degree in Physics in 1999 followed by a PhD in Biophysics in 2003 at the Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) with an emphasis on the structure–activity relationship of cationic liposome/DNA complexes. Then I completed my postdoctoral formation at the synchrotron light source of Elettra (Trieste, Italy) and at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California at Irvine (CA, USA). I am currently Associate Professor of Medical Physics at the Molecular Medicine Department of the Sapienza University of Rome. My main interest is understanding the bio–nano interactions between drug and gene delivery systems and biological media. The relationships between synthetic identity, biological identity and physiological response of drug delivery systems will enable researchers to predict their physiological response after administration <em>in vivo</em>. This would represent a truly new paradigm in the field of pharmaceutics and nanomedicine. Another project deals with the exploitation of the nanoparticle-protein corona for early detection of cancer and other diseases.
