I obtained my degree in Physics in 2000 at the Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) followed by a PhD in Physics in 2004 at the Roma Tre University of Rome (Italy), with a thesis focused on a possible relationship between structure and function of gene delivery systems. I completed postdoctoral studies at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of California at Irvine (CA, USA). I currently serve as Associate Professor of Medical Physics at the Molecular Medicine Department of the Sapienza University of Rome. I am currently working on investigating the mechanisms of action of drug delivery systems at the cellular level. This knowledge will be incorporated in the rational design of novel and efficient drug and gene delivery systems for both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> applications.
