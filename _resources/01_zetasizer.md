Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is a widely used technique to measure the size distribution of small particles in solution. In our lab, we routinely characterize nanoparticles by means of a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 system (Malvern). The same instrument is provided with a Micro Electrophoretic Light Scattering set up, which is employed to measure Zeta potentials. Thus, information about size and surface charge of nanoparticles are obtained.
