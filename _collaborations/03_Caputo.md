Formerly friend and partner hanging aroung and hiting the town, Damiano is a surgeon who, taking advantage of every millisecond of the day, divides himself between clinical activity and scientific research. Damiano has been fundamental in translating our scientific outcomes into really applicable clinical technologies. If today the Nanodelivery Lab is a unique place where we fulfill the gap between benchtop discoveries and clinical application most of the merit goes to Damiano's passion and constant self-denial. The gifts of food and wine he generously brings back from his holidays are delicious.
