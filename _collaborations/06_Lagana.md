Aldo is a chemist, a smart elegant man with the genuine enthusiasm of a boy. We had to overcome some obstacles to start collaborating with Aldo, but the efforts have been fully rewarded by over ten years of fruitful and enjoyable collaboration. When Aldo welcomed us into his group we felt at home and our scientific marriage has been amazing. Thanks to his state-of-the-art facilities, his correctness and his endless enthusiasm for new challenges, Aldo allowed us to open new horizons in the field of the protein corona.
