We met Francesco in California where both of us were joining the Enrico Grattonâ€™s Lab. Francesco is a biologist by training and a biophysicist by attitude who uses fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate complex biological processes at the cellular level. Together with Francesco we enjoy exploring the mechanisms of action of delivery systems and his support is fundamental to advance the delivery technologies developed in the Lab. Our football metaphors are amazing. "The Miro Klose of Fluorescence" was his first nickname. Nothing more correct.
