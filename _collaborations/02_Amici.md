Augusto and Cristina are biologists by training and introduced us to cell biology more than 15 years ago. The possibility of expanding the research of the lab in the biomedical field is mainly due to the passion and competence of Augusto and Cristina. The evenings spent together in the Camerino farmhouses with excellent food and wine have made our friendship stronger and inspired our research in the field of gene delivery.
