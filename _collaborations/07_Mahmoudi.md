When we virtually met Morteza on a popular social media, we wouldn't have thought our partnership would become so close and fruitful. A few years later, a lobster salad in a pleasant Boston venue marked the beginning of an enduring scientific marriage. As a renowned nanoscientist in the field of bio-nano interactions and father of the “personalized protein corona”, we are so glad that Morteza shares his own research interests with the lab and actively participates in many common research projects about the protein corona. In addition to all this, Morteza is also the founder and director of the Academic Parity Movement, a nonprofit organization that aims to address academic bullying through research and awareness.
