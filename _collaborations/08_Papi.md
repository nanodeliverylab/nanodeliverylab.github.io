Massimiliano, Massi for friends, is a physicist by training with a passion for theoretical physics, comics, good reads and all the pleasures of life. Massi helps us to explore the role of the protein corona on the biological activity of liposomal drugs and to develop new technologies for early diagnosis of cancer. A night with Massi is never trivial, lovely dinners and long walks downtown drinking a beer have often been a source of inspiration for the lab's research activities.
