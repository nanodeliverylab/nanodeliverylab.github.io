Physicist by training Heinz is a multitalented scientist who introduced us to the amazing world of synchrotron SAXS more than 15 years ago. With his transversal knowledge and skills as well as his enthusiastic attitude, Heinz has been one of the main protagonists of the lab's growth. Going for experiments to the synchrotron SAXS beamline he leads in Trieste is always a pleasure for the labâ€™s staff and spending afterwards an unforgettable night with Heinz and his amazing wife Shiva is one of the most beautiful events of the year.
