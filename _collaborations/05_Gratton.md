Enrico is the founder and principal investigator of the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics and he is one of the most eminent scientists in the field of fluorescence spectroscopy worldwide. Enrico generously allowed us to join his lab for many months helping us to explore the mechanisms of nanovector-cell interaction with unprecedented level of accuracy. Fun evenings at Enrico's home in San Clemente with an amazing view of the Pacific Ocean are a memorable event.
